Date: March 29, 2025
Time: 14:22 UTC
Priority: Critical

Description:
Anomalous activity detected in nuclear facility control systems. Temperature readings for cooling systems show unexpected fluctuations. 
Engineering workstation showing unusual outbound network connections. Historian server logs indicate unauthorized access attempts.

Initial observations:
1. Control system safety parameters modified outside of change management window
2. Unusual network traffic detected between engineering workstation and historian server
3. Multiple failed login attempts on control network devices
4. Cooling system reporting inconsistent temperature readings

Immediate actions required:
1. Conduct triage to determine affected systems
2. Collect forensic artifacts from potentially compromised devices
3. Analyze artifacts to identify root cause
4. Implement recovery procedures

NOTE: This is a potential safety-critical incident. Follow nuclear facility incident response procedures.
