NUCLEAR FACILITY CONTROL SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION
===============================================

Network Architecture:
- 172.31.24.0/24: IT Network (Workstations, General IT)
- 172.31.37.0/24: Operation Technology DMZ (Historian, Engineering Workstations)
- 172.31.64.0/24: Control Network (PLCs, RTUs, Control Systems)

Critical Systems:
1. Historian Server (172.31.37.30)
   - Stores historical process data
   - Runs OSIsoft PI historian software
   - Connected to both IT and OT networks

2. Engineering Workstation (172.31.24.15)
   - Used for configuring control systems
   - Has direct access to control network
   - Used by maintenance personnel

3. Control System PLCs (172.31.64.20-25)
   - Responsible for critical operations including cooling systems
   - Modbus TCP protocol on port 502
   - Key register addresses:
     * 4032: MAX_TEMP_THRESHOLD (°C) - Critical safety parameter
     * 4033: ALARM_TRIGGER_DELAY (seconds) - Delay before alarm activation
     * 4034: SAFETY_OVERRIDE (boolean) - Bypasses certain safety checks when set to 1

Authorized Users:
- admin: System administrator, full access
- operator: Control system operator, read all/write limited
- maintenance: Maintenance staff, read all/limited write access

Normal Operations:
- MAX_TEMP_THRESHOLD should never exceed 100°C
- ALARM_TRIGGER_DELAY should be 30-60 seconds
- SAFETY_OVERRIDE should always be 0 during normal operations
- All changes should follow change management procedures
